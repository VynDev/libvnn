# libvnn (Vyn Neural Network)

This is a neural network library made in C++, i created it to learn about neural networks and data science so it may contains errors and/or not being compatible with you OS/Version

## Examples of projects using libvnn

### CarGenAI
Cars learning to drive in Unreal Engine 4 using genetic algorithm

## Requirements

- Linux
- g++
- make

## Compilation

You can compile it as a static or a shared library:
- **make static** to get the static version (libvnn.a)
- **make dynamic** to get the shared version (libvnn.so)

## Documentation

There is no documentation available for the moment because the lib is still experimental/in development.
